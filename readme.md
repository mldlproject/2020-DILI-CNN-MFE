**Abstract**: As a critical issue in drug discovery and development, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) leads to failures in 
clinical trials as well as retractions of on-market approved drugs. Therefore, it is important to identify DILI compounds in 
early-stage through in silico and in vivo studies. It is difficult using conventional safety testing methods since the predictive 
power of most existing frameworks is insufficiently effective to address this pharmacological issue. In our study, we propose an 
NLP-inspired computational framework using convolutional neural networks and molecular fingerprint-embedded features. Our development 
set and independent test set have 1597 and 322 compounds, respectively. These samples were collected from previous studies and matched 
with established chemical databases for structural validity.

**Results**: Our study comes up with the averaged accuracy of 0.735, MCC of 0.525, and AUC of 0.950. Our results show a significant 
improvement in the AUC values compared to the recently best model with a boost of 5%, from 0.904 to 0.950. In addition, based on our 
findings, molecular fingerprint-embedded features were proven as effective tools for future biological and biochemical studies besides 
the application of classic molecular fingerprints.
